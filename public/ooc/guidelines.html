        <p class="font-fantasie inner-h2">How to use the InCharacter Commands</p>
        <p>Whenever you put a number DIRECTLY AFTER the command, you're specifying range, some commands have fixed range, some others don't</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>/talk: </b> Automatically used whenever you use the letter T to speak, has a spherical range of 15 tiles, it's overriden by /say so don't use /say</li>
            <li><b>/y: </b> Yelling, has a range of 70 blocks so it's always supposed to be yelling at full strength</li>
            <li><b>/w: </b> Whispering, has a range of 3 blocks, people are only going to hear if they are directly next to you</li>
            <li><b>/em [range]: </b> Emote, takes a range, it's usage is pretty open, from applying a 70 range to flipping the bird to someone at the other side of the battlefield, to applying 3 range to ERP. Minimum range is 3, maximum is 70. It can be used to speak (Raising your voice but not reaching full yell)</li>
            <li><b>/ooc: </b> Speak globally and out of character</li>
            <li><b>/spy [name] [s/w/y]: </b> ONLY USABLE BY ROGUES. Impersonates someone else and replicates either "talk", "whisper" or "yell"</li>
            <li><b>/aspy [name] [range]: </b> ONLY USABLE BY ROGUES. Impersonates someone else and replicates emoting</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-fantasie inner-h2">How to interpret certain situations</p>
        <p>Some situations in roleplay might need some additional flavor to them and the usage of imagination</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Building:</b> Even if characters need to build, because this is minecraft, it's roleplayed that they are "overseeing a group of contractors/servants, etc"... Unless the character states otherwise with roleplay</li>
