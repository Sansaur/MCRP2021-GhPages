        <p><b>Acquiring NPCs:</b> Before you can buy an NPC to live in your base, you must build them a suitable living space</p>
        <p><b>Acquiring Special Buildings:</b> These improve the NPCs, your PVP abilities, or your progression</p>
        <p><b>Class/Faction powers:</b> All of these require admin interventions, so understand if admins aren't available</p>
        <p>FACTION-WIDE PURCHASES can be paid with a "bank" of points that are contributed by players or awarded by roleplay!!</p>
