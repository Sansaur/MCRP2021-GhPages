        <p>The people who want to course through a dungeon must first post public roleplays of how they came to know of their existance, and who are the people that will form the team</p>
        <p>This team must wait for 10 minutes before they can begin their raid, and they can only begin if an admin has given the signal as the "overseer"</p>
        <p>If another team of players wants to join or intercept the other teams, they must also post a roleplay post of their intentions publicly on discord</p>
        <p>These players don't need to wait the 10 minutes to either join or intercept IF the other players have already started the dungeon, but they won't get any help reaching it</p>

        <p>Dungeons will be full of NPCs and mobs that will attack the players to block their path to loot. Loot is usually a boost to regular player progression, but sometimes unique items can be found</p>
        <p><b>DO NOT BREAK BLOCKS IN THE DUNGEON, BREAKING BLOCKS IS FORBIDDEN UNLESS THE DUNGEON ITSELF SPECIFICES THEY CAN BE BROKEN</b></p>
        <p><b>If a player fully dies (The revive timer ends) during a dungeon they cannot come back.</b></p>
        <p><b>If all the players that have signed up to the dungeon in a prior manner die, the dungeon is over</b></p>
        <p><b>The only ways a fully dead player can come back to the dungeon is through a Healer that has the ressurrection spell, or a Shaman who spends 15 RP to Psychopomp</b></p>
        <p>NPCs do not respawn, but they regenerate health outside of combat</p>
        <p>Bosses regenerate their health really fast outside of combat</p>
        <p>Bosses can enter an ENRAGE phase, if they have a target and they cannot reach it, they will first boost their movement speed to maximum speed, and if they still don't reach, they will teleport to the target</p>
        <p>Dungeons are in an early phase and sometimes things might go wrong, that's why an admin must be there, to take notes apart to take screenshots</p>
