        <p>Within a faction there are people with power, but they must be elected</p>
        <ul class="pl-5 list-unstyled">
            <li>To elect a possible person of power, every 4 weeks a vote will be casted to replace or mantain the current people in power</li>
            <li>During the time between each election, it's possible to declare actions within the faction, both events and PVP as "campaigning"</li>
            <li class="restricted-color">If an event declared as campaigning is succesful, the campaign will generate APPROVAL for the person who asked for it</li>
            <li class="restricted-color">Events can be boycotted through regular well-escalated PVP, this causes them to fail</li>
            <li class="restricted-color">Premeditated Aggressions can be used to lower someone's APPROVAL greatly, around 10 times the amount generated by campaigning, plus, they must spend at least three days taken out and unable to campaign</li>
            <li class="wild-color">If any of these attempts at generating APPROVAL fail, the APPROVAL is instead taken away from the people involved in the attempt to generate it</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>What is approval for?:</b> For each player in a faction there is a vote casted by NPCs, NPCs will vote to whoever has the highest approval in the moment they run for a role unless their scores are really close to someone else's, then they are divided by the amount of NPCs and every vote by an NPC reduces the current approval, and if it reduces it more than the other candidate's approval, the opposite candidate takes the next vote instead</p>
        <p><b>How does voting work?:</b> For each important role at the moment of voting, in the order of the list below, each player may declare they run for it, both players and NPCs will cast their votes then</p>
        <p><b>Where will approval be tracked?:</b> In the character list</p>
        <p>After every election, Approval is reset to 0 unless there are special circumstances</p>
