        <p class="inner-h2">The rise of the Dark Lord</p>
        <p class="pl-3">
            For over five hundred years the forces of the Lord of all Creatures, Exilo, managed to assert an almost full control of all of the
            called "Creatures of the Night"; Beasts, demons, undead, even the outworlders. He united them under the same banner and served as a
            ruthless tactician to slowly conquer every single territory to be found and mark this world as his, wiping out a great percentage
            of human dwellings in the span of a few months
        </p>
        <p class="inner-h2">The fall of the Dark Lord</p>
        <p class="pl-3">
            But even while having full control of every single creature of the night, Exilo met his end eventually. The humans allied with the sturdy
            dwarves and the immortal elves and they created a Coalition, letting go of disputes of the past to fight the threat of Exilo under the same warbanner.
            This alliance was expected, and Exilo shot back at full force, but a certain group of heroes surged from within the Coalition and wielding
            an immesurable power managed to cut through all of Exilo's defenses and strike both him and every other great commander of the Creatures of the Night down.
            <br>
            <br>
            After Exilo's defeat and then banishment from reality, the Undead great commander ressurrected himself, and the Outworld great commander reformed...
            They immediately cut any ties with the Creatures of the Night, even declaring hostility against them, this was considered a sign of great treason by 
            the creatures, and they declared an ever-lasting hostility against them until the end of time... Even then, the rage held by the followers of Exilo wasn't
            enough to fight back the Coalition, aided by the Undead and the Outworlders, who forced the creatures back into Exilo's fortress, and once there, they
            executed every single remaining great commander, and then left the surrendering remnants of the Creatures of the Night to rot within the castle
        </p>
        <p class="inner-h2">Signs of a new age</p>
        <p class="pl-3">
            It's only been a few weeks since that, and the wounds seem like they will never heal, the remnants of the Creatures of the Night have walled themselves
            inside the destroyed castle of Exilo, where they have planned in ways of how to restore their former glory, or at least return to a normal life even, but
            of course, it's a daunting task, outside the Coalition continues, keeping their guard up, and they've even formed a truce with the Undead and the Outworlders
            as long as they keep the Creatures in check, which slows down the Creatures even further...
            <br>
            <br>
            That is, until a fragment of Exilo appeared out of nowhere, a much less powerful and smaller version of himself manifested amongst their peers, and he
            brought a message: He's completely unable to fully break the veil between realities, but he can manifest an "astral" version of himself to infuse just a
            small portion of his power into his followers, enough to escape the stalemate... But from now on, the future of the Creatures of the Night must be guided
            by others.
            <br>
            <br>
            And with that said, he appointed new leaders, even if not as powerful as the Great Commanders, these will be new guides for the Creatures in these times
            of turmoil.
