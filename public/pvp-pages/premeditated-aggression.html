            <li>A premeditated aggression is the act in which a specific character is targeted to be attacked and it doesn't happen at random</li>
            <li>Premeditated aggression plans must be made public through the Discord server</li>
            <li class="pl-5">This DOES NOT mean that the defending faction can know about it In Character</li>
            <li class="pl-5">But they are encouraged to use spies if they have them to find out IC</li>
            <li class="pl-5">Aggressors cannot attack their target until an hour has passed since their public outing of their plans</li>
            <li>If the target is killed after this ritual, the following happens:</li>
            <li class="pl-5">The aggressors can roleplay the scenes that are in the character's Restricted whitelist of actions when targeted, or anything if the character is Wild (Max duration of 30 minutes)</li>
            <li class="pl-5">The scene then ends with the character either wounded or dead at discretion of the victim</li>
            <li class="pl-5">If the victim character is dead, the victim cannot play with that character temporarily until a ressurrection roleplay is performed</li>
            <li class="pl-5">They may elect to make this death a permanent one and not ever be ressurrected</li>
            <li>Premeditated aggression has a 3 day cooldown</li>
