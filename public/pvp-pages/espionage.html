            <li>Players who have the "Rogue" skill may change their ingame name, and their ingame model to a model of either another player or another person</li>
            <li>Temporarily become friendly with the NPCs</li>
            <li>Doing this would allow you to easily sneak into an enemy faction's base and know of their plans, the contents of their chests, etc... (Turrets and other NPCs still detect you)</li>
            <li>If a faction finds out about a spy, they can attack them without much escalation, and then elect to either kidnap or PK them</li>
            <li>If a faction is hostile against another, the players of these factions MAY NOT wander in the territories of another faction when there's noone of that faction online</li>
            <li>Espionage opens up the possibility of Heists, they are the only allowed way to steal from another faction's coffers, and they are a FactionVFaction event</li>
            <li>Has 2 hours of cooldown</li>
