        <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>To kidnap a player they must be PK'd with blunt weapons first and then helped up</li>
            <li>To kidnap a player the aggressor needs a holding cell or a prison within their base</li>
            <li>Only one person from each faction may be kidnapped at a time</li>
            <li>A player about to be kidnapped can pick one of two choices on how to proceed:</li>
            <li>KIDNAPPED FOR REAL</li>
            <li class="pl-5">Their items will be placed inside an admin-chest</li>
            <li class="pl-5">Ransom will be played out with full roleplay</li>
            <li class="pl-5">The kidnapepd player must obey what the kidnapper asks them to do</li>
            <li class="pl-5">Kidnapped players cannot fight back unless the kidnapper allows for it</li>
            <li class="pl-5">Kidnapped players can switch to the other mode of kidnapping at any time, but not vicecersa</li>
            <li class="pl-5">A kidnapping may only last up to 2 IRL hours (Unless the kidnapped absolutely wants to continue)</li>
            <li>NPC STAND-IN</li>
            <li class="pl-5">An NPC with the player's skin will be placed in the kidnapper's prison</li>
            <li class="pl-5">Ransom will be played out with full roleplay</li>
            <li class="pl-5">The "kidnapped" player cannot join any efforts against the kidnapping faction</li>
            <li class="pl-5">Since NPC pathing is wonky, to rescue an NPC kidnap victim the rescuers must simply defend the location for 2 minutes</li>
            <li class="pl-5">This still only lasts up to 2 IRL hours</li>
            <li>Nobody from the affected faction can be kidnapped again for the rest of the day after a kidnapping took place</li>
        </ul>
