            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>
                A furred drider, relatively small for her kind. Her spider body is supported by six legs, with two smaller ones at her thighs, which not always touch the ground or assist in walking.<br><br>
                The hair on her body are various shades of gray, shortening up at the end of her hands, legs and ears to reveal a skin complexion adapted to low light environments. Her four eyes are a deep gray, squint in the light and excel in the dark, reflecting back any single light source in her eyes if she were spotted in the night.<br><br>
                If given a closer look, tangerine highlights mark parts of her upper- as well as spider body. Her hair is silky and sometimes even styled into a ponytail, around her neck sits a fluffy collar of spider fuzz, a nice contrast to the otherwise squalid monster.<br><br>

            <p>
                A forgotten explorer who fell victim to a powerful drider. Suffering the same fate as she once did, in a ritual she was re-born as fellow drider. One day another explorer heard of rumors and came by, managing to slay the superior drider. Undiscovered, the smaller drider is left behind to continue the cycle, with only faint memories remaining of her past life and sanity.
