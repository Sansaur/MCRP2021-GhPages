            <p>
                Durimdig was like any other dwarf before the rise of Exilio, just one more of the small people mining and perfecting blacksmithing in grand mountain cities. The only problem he had was how his talent was shackled by the rules and regulations placed upon him by rulers, elders and even his peers with somewhat higher standing. So when the dark lord laid waste to the land and promised him freedom of creation if he only would share the secrets of dwarven blacksmithing he took the offer without giving it much thought. He lived for his art, not for good-for-nothing senile old men dictating how a hammer should be made, which ironically saved him when Exilio fell. As his fortress and the beasts were being destroyed and hunted, he remained underground, hammering away at his forge until one day he got curious as to why no one was coming by to collect the weapons he had made.
                <br><br>
                Coming out he soon got to speed on what happened, witnesses who explained the events to the travelling dwarf stated that he quite literally "Shrugged his arms and said 'serves him right for not wearing that ring I made for him, I'm off to find a better mine' before going down the road with a pile of iron in tow". Maybe those folks who seem to know their way with machinery will let him stay around for a while.
