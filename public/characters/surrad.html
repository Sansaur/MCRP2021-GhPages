            <p>
                Surrad served the dark lord Exilo among specialized warriors of the sky; a team of monsters capable of flight, some grew accustomed to calling them Sky Wardens. the agility of these fighters could not me matched not even the best Cavaliers. Surrad's team was not overseeing Exilo's protection but was in range to respond should they be needed. The forces of good took a pre-emptive strike before they could come to the dark lord's aid. the resulting strike was devastating although Surrad managed to escape the battle nearly took his life and him scarred.
