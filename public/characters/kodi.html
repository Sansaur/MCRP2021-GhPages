            <p>
                A male anthropomorphic monstrous feline, standing 12 foot-tall, a mixture between a cat and a gnoll. His body shows a snow leopard's fur pattern, with the same depth to his fur. His frame is burly, covered in muscles that make him reach a weight of 600lbs (272kgs).<br>
                The sides of his head sport two pairs of bovine ears, one at each side, decorated with bright-colored piercings, from the cheeks two horns come out towards the sides and then they point forwards, while from the top of his head, two horns poke out pointing backwards.<br>
                The charr can walk either on two legs or as a quadruped, usually preferring this second method of movement over long distances.
