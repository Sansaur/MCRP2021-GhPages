            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>
                An unusually large canid, seemingly composed of forest litter - dead branches and mossy stone, dry leaves and fresh saplings, wound together in the shape of a 
                familiar beast. It's a magical beast, that much anyone can sight-read, but her quiet grace, her gentle nature, a sense of whimsy in her interactions, these 
                and other quirks seem to set her apart from a creature of the night, something... welcoming, but strange.<br><br>
                All around her, flora stretches and blooms, seemingly inspired by her presence, fruit growing plump and tumbling off the vine. Physically, her shoulder rises 
                3ft, and her eyeline is roughly chest-level to the common human. Being composed not of meat and bone but plant-stuff, she weighs in at an unnaturally-light 60lbs, 
                lightening her step but oftentimes seriously impacting her ability to generate force.

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                TBD - Outline; There have always been spirits of nature, but it takes some strange and world-altering circumstances to manifest them. <br><br>
                This one is adjusting to life as more than an idea of spirit, but a physical manifestation of those qualities, disconnected from the great wheel, unable to draw on the 
                knowledge of all nature as they once did.<br><br>
                Like a ... fallen angel, but from the natural realm instead of heaven, without the condemnation aspect. She was literally shaken out of the cosmos by the events of Exilo's 
                fall and resurrection.<br><br>
                Now she's just doing what she knows - spreading fertility, peace, and good fortune.<br><br>
