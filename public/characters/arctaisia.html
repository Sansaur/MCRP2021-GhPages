            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>
                Fairly slim build, grey-blue scales, with two maroon stripes across the top of their boxy snout. Their eyes seem to have two pupils within them. 
                Their mouth only opens up and down when talking, or doing regular activities, but seems to have an additional seam running down the height of their snout, 
                splitting it into four segments. Their legs are standard digitigrade-style, with large, bulky feet on the bottom. They appear to be wearing a diamond ring, 
                and a brass cog-style ring on their right hand. From Arc's head a snowy-white hair, reaching down to what you would presume is his lower back, formed into a neat ponytail. 
                A set of four beige horns poke out of the back of their skull.

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                Arctaisia was an outcast for most of his life, having been what was a standard little lizard boy, before a small discovery of a radioactive ore deposit 
                left him a little dizzy. He took a chink of this odd, vibrantly orange rock home, then he gave it a lick, as lizards do.. To him, it felt warm, so he kept 
                it in his pocket as a pocket warmer. Though as time went on, Arc started to feel pain around his hip region, eventually spreading to his whoke body after years of exposure. 
                <br><br>
                This escalated to incredible agony, poor Arctaisia was awake for many nights as his body was corrupted by this odd mineral, unbeknownst to him. The more he tried to search for a 
                magic user to heal him of his ailments, the more they failed, or the more he was turned away.
                <br><br>
                His face changed, his scales greyed, lightening in colour, while his eyes malformed into the dual-binocular array they are today. 
                The unfortunate lizard, now only a teenager, saw himself as hideous. He cast aside all his contacts, and lived in relative solace for years, 
                left with his own thoughts. Had he been cursed? Bewitched? He couldn't tell, but perhaps his anger, and with a little convenient stone nearby allowed him to vent 
                said negative emotions, his window didn't last... Now, with the cancerous toxic rock gone, Arctaisia's body slowed it's changes, though they didn't stop. He grew a multitude 
                of tumours, which he cut off, or burnt away, fortunately surviving any life-threatening ones that may have occured in his internals. 
                <br><br>
                To preoccupy himself, he slowly learnt the basics of engineering and sciences of the time, the dusted books on the shelves he fortunately didn't burn for fire in the winter.
                Finally, the creature came to odds with themself, 
                just shy of adulthood, coming from their hiding that they rarely left prior, and in no time, after gathering supplies, Arc set out. He learnt the trades, and after multiple bad 
                run-ins with those that thought he was a demon, or undead, he had some basic skills in combat, nothing extraordinary, but he would commonly create weapons on the road, from 
                whatever he found lying around. For years, this critter was nomadic, until they finally found a faction of fairly likeminded individuals.
