            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>
                Arta is a proud Peacock standing tall at 6'1, and a healthy weight of 140lbs. A royal blue coat of feathers covers him head to knee, 
                his calves a dull yellow, ending in a three toed bird foot. Atop Arta's head sit flowing locks of light brunette hair, his hair parted unevenly, 
                and forswept to the right, his hair is dyed a lighter sky-blue, and the shorter half on the left dyed a shade of sea-green, 
                leaving a ponytail hanging from the back of his head as his natural hair color. His crest of thin black feathers, 
                ending in blue rounded tips are tied around his hair, forming the ponytail, and creating a regal appearance, a centurian-like crest 
                rising from his head. The regular blue of his face broken up by large white markings above and under each of his wide, yellow eyes, 
                resembling a white mask atop his face. 
                <br>
                Arta speaks slowly and concisely through a short, knife-sharp bright yellow beak. Where Arta marches, 
                a train of long, rustling feathers follows, draping nearly 3 meters behind him resembling a royal procession, At his desire, shock, or various 
                other usually hidden emotions, Arta's tail raises, as a peacock's does, towering over his head, and spreading like a fan, each tall feather 
                ending in a beautiful blue pattern resembling an eye, and many of them. The sound of Arta's tail rustling closely resembles leaves being scattered 
                across a forest floor, the first meter of his tail closest to his hip is covered by a velvet, purple decorative cloak. which hangs at his side when 
                his tail is raised, ending close to his ankle, but not touching the floor.
                <br>
                Arta's outfit changes vastly and often depending on the day and his mood, 
                varying from brightly colored vests, to luxurious velvet robes. Each step Arta takes is done with grace and the levity of an experienced dancer, no 
                missteps, no mistakes, sure in every movement he makes, or at least pretending so. He appears to always be glancing down his beak at those around him, 
                whether it's his height or his attitude, he radiates an overpowering sense of self importance and superiority.

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                Coming from a rich and powerful family built on the back of a conglomerate of Elven, Dwarven, and human crafters and artists. 
                If you point to any ornate building or statue in the capital cities, Arta's family had money put into it. When the coalition's leaders 
                were meeting in secret, Arta's money was paying off the guards to keep any of Exilo's spies away. When the Coalition needed agents in 
                Exilo's workforce, Arta's craftsmen were always the first in line to report back on the layouts, secret passages, or structural weaknesses, 
                planned or otherwise, to the coalition leaders. Arta's money paid for soldiers, weapons, and gifts to sway lords who were apprehensive about 
                aligning against Exilo's forces. Hailed as a hero, Arta's position in the new governments was not just guaranteed, but to deny him his position 
                after such a massive undertaking would have seemed an equally large injustice. Arta spends his days overseeing the construction of a new 
                governmental manor befitting his new title and responsibility.
