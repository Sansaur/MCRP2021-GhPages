            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                Grit has not always been a lonely kobold, he belonged to a large family of the same race but they were terribly slaughtered by the disgusting humans. Now he prefers to live in a lonely desert that borders whit a beautiful and lush forest habited by animals and magical creatures that seem to take care of the place, that makes him feel secretly comfortable and he has decided to move not far from them.
