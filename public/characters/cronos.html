            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                He lost his family after the fall of the dark lord and learned by force to be able to survive polishing his qualities of rogue and deception, he is attracted to engineering and developed some inventions by studying some stolen books.
                One night, pursued by human guards after stealing some food, he was dazzled by Sigdra's whisper, calling on him to follow him in exchange for the promise of vengeance and power. So he spent the rest of his days until today as one of his shadows, venturing to build a new temple in the name of his god to carry his name as high pontiff further and further.
