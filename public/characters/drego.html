            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>
                Measures:<br>
                3.15 m from the ground to the head<br>
                2.20 m from the ground to the spine<br>
                6.20 m from chest to the tip of the tail<br>
                3.00 m from chest to the tailhead.<br>
                3.20 m from the tailhead to the tip of the tail<br>
                Wings -> 3.8 m long when extended<br>

                Membranous wings, coated with black and yellow waterproof feathers, which make him able to fly even when raining. In the joints of these, he has an orange claw-shaped spine, which are also in each wing “finger” end.<br>
                Dregonard’s tail is long and strong, which allows him to encircle a furry’s body and raise it with no problem. Its end is adorned with black and yellow feathers, as in his wings.<br>
                Red scales covering the whole body and yellow scales inside ears and half of the mouth. From the neck they turn into wide v-shaped plates which go along neck, chest, belly and the low side of the tail until the tip.<br>
                Dregonard’s scales are really resistant and the touch of it is used to be soft, but hard as polished metal.<br>
                The red and yellow colours represent the fire so, besides he can exhale it through mouth and nose, Dregonard’s temperature is warmer than the usual in a normal body. <br>
                Two flat horns in the head, slightly curved to the back, the colour is orange, like the wings spikes and the claws.<br>
                Crystal intensive-green eyes that can glow o get darker depending on the feelings of Dregonard.<br>
                Dregonard can disengage his jaw as a snake would, allowing him to expand his throat when necessary and, given that fact and his size, he can swallow a whole furry or a human.<br>

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                Commanded by Exilo, Dregonard was sent to the fight near the school of the mages, but ended up hurt near its gates. The dragon thought that he had no possibility of survival. He was not only gravely injured but also had heard about the horrible experiments that mages did to his race from him in that place. He was surprised when the mages healed his wounds from him using their magic from him, giving him the opportunity to return with the rest of his kind.
                After some time, when Exilo started to lose the war, Dregonard went to the rescue of those who saved him, protecting the mages from the siege of their school and taking them to a safe place. Thus avoiding being killed like the rest of the dragons in a great battle where they were in the frontline. 
                That's how Dregonard ended being one of the last feral dragons. Having no home to return to, he decided to stay with the mages, becoming a protector for their scholl of magic and in a very rare and coveted creature being among the last of his kind of him.
