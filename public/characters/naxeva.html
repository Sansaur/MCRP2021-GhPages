            <p>
                Before you stands a towering half-dragon half-human hybrid, also known as a Drakyn. Naxeva appears to be a large and quite friendly male, 
                eager to talk about anything and everything; trying to learn all he can from anyone he encounters. His shining hazel eyes appear to 
                constantly scan his entire surroundings looking for anything or anyone he can use to learn more. If you were to take a simple glance at him; 
                you would notice that his arms and legs appear to be that of a dragon,with wings to match; although the rest of him would be human, 
                except for the horns growing from the top of his head; although one of them would appear to have a nick near the base.

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                Naxeva was born to a Human mother and a Brass Dragon father; although he began to travel the world on his sixteenth birthday, 
                a desire to explore the world and learn all it had to teach deep inside him. As he left and began to travel to his homeland's capitol, 
                he very quickly found himself lost in a grim badlands after he had taken a wrong turn. It did not take long for an odd manner of shadowy 
                creatures to begin attacking him, severely wounding him and managing to almost cut off his left horn. Luckily his pained whimpers and groans 
                had allowed Arctaisia to find him and attempt to nurse him back to health; conversing with him about what they were doing and where they were going all the while.
                <br><br>
                Soon, they had healed him and were soon to part ways, before Naxeva had an idea, and asked if he could accompany them on their travels; 
                surely having a companion to travel with would help alleviate any issues in the future and also would give them both someone to talk to.
