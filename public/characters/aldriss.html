            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>
                Aldriss is a moderately sized feral dragoness, standing at a height from ground to spine of 2.15 meters with a proportional, much longer body covered in several tones of green well-maintained scales and a light yellowish, resistant yet soft leathery hide on the limb joints, underside and un-scaled places of her body. <br><br>
                Her head has the usual intimidating facets of most dragons, thought with slightly rounded and smoother edges which remove some of the scarier details. Two single slightly backwards curved horns protrude from the back of her head, seemingly as a decoration yet hardened, and durable like any other. <br><br>
                Her body looks healthy, a big mass of muscles and bones fit for a member of her race but without said musculature being too defined or visible, making her look more elegant than intimidating, even though she’s on pair with any others. The scales on her back, legs and tails would be some of the largest and strongest looking ones dotting her body, allowing for some protection against basic blunt or sharp injuries. Her lower body, on the contrary, is covered in much less durable, softer to the touch and warmer hide where one could even hear her heartbeat if they placed their head right atop of it. On her upper back there are two massive green wings attached to her shoulder blade region, each made out of hollow bones and thin green-toned hide that's translucent against bright lights, which allow her to fly in open spaces. These wings, thought, are by far some of the most fragile parts of her body, meaning she'd have them folded the whole time unless there's a need to showcase them or fly.<br><br>
                Her legs would be thick and well-built due to the constant task of having to move and carry the entire dragon's body weight about, but nonetheless not ruining the overall sleek over fierce look she had. They'd be covered in the same hardened green scales as her back and tail, though the inner sides would lack some on the upper section to give way to softer and much more flexible hide.<br><br>

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>As most other creatures of the time, Aldriss followed Exilo in his quest for domination and conquest as a powerful winged ally with an affinity for more obscure arts. Her deviancy from the other dragons came surprisingly from her love of… Cooking. She had an affinity for taste and culinary arts, testing and tasting new things at every opportunity, always mixing her duties with her hobby. She avoided the grim fate of most of others of her kind by simple chance, missing the order to fight in the frontlines right as she retired to the fortress for a few ingredients she missed out on, the news of Exilo’s defeat shocking her as much as the brutality of the coalition as they swept the remains of the night creatures. Forced to deal with the misery that followed, Aldriss used her own arts to aid the wounded and lift their spirits, ending up with a new set of skills: That of a healer.
