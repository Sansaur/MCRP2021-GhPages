            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>
                A black serpent, a naga, with obsidian-colored scales that spread across his slender body around 5m in total in length but usually towering others at 2.5m tall when he adopts a fully straight upwards
                position. His eyes are crimson and with an unnatural glint at the bottom of their circumference, this glint leaves a red trail whenever the naga moves his head quickly, and if stared at for a long
                enough time it might have an hypnotic effect.
                <br><br>
                His hood is thick yet not long, extending outwards just around the length of half a forearm, his snout is blunt and short, not letting his fangs become visible through it's width.
                His body sports a fair bit of muscle around his shoulders and upper arms, giving him a masculine shape on them, but it quickly loses width around his lower chest area, quickly slipping into
                the slender shape of his naga tail, giving him an overall toned appearance.

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                Asahn's bloodline is closely related to a clan that has dedicated their lives to the teachings of the Father of Serpents, but his family specifically was torn away from their peers long
                ago, designed as front-line guardians in far-away lands, protecting the territories that crossed with those of humans. This allowed the Desz family to not only face the invasive forces
                of human imperialists, but also meet the Rynkiewicz family, who also dwelled in the crossroads between humans and the creatures of the night.
                <br><br>
                This relationship slowly allowed the clan to reveal themselves to Exilo, and having seen firsthand the disregard humans had for their fatherly god, they decided to officially join the 
                creatures of the night, as front-line fighters alongside the Rynkiewciz enforcers, creating a barrier that protected both Yig's central temple within a now lost island, and many of the
                inner allies within Exilo's army.
                <br><br>
                But it was a short-lived affair, when the humans made allies of dwarves and elves, and then the undead and outworlders betrayed Exilo... The Desz clan was first in line, alongside the
                family of overlords they had helped through a decade, and they were in the receiving end of a slaughter, most of the clan was butchered in a desperate and instinctive effort to defend
                what was theirs, but only those who either were lucky enough to be rescued or weren't in the territory at the time survived... Asahn was within Rynkiewciz's territories, greeting his
                allies as a witch doctor after years of training, and by the time his greeting was over, the family's dominion was attacked...
                <br><br>
                As a lucky survivor, Asahn has heard from the whispers behind the walls that his clan has decided to sink the temple to the father of snakes, hiding it as they saw the destruction of
                so many sanctuaries built by the Desz... The black naga has remained behind, as one of the few members of his family, still with an oath to keep as a doctor to the Rynkiewciz family,
                even if most of their bloodline is currently deceased, he still wishes to preserve as much as he can from his old life.
