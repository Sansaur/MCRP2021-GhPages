            <p>
                Kaizaan is a dark grey wolf, standing at about 7ft tall. He looks to be in his late-twenties. There are not many defining features across his body aside from few visible patches of roughed up fur, likely from combat. His general physique is well built. Clearly able to handle larger weapons, given his upbringing as a blacksmith. He always seems to have a smile on his face, something cynical about him though.

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                He was born into your average blacksmithing family, as an only child. The times were tough, given that there was constant pillaging and dismay among the few remaining settlements. His father was the income bringer of the family, and Kaizaan, being the industrious type that he was, wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps. This worked out for Kaizaan as his father also wanted him to learn blacksmithing. His upbringing consisted mainly of helping his parents, namely his father and learning how to forge tools and weapons. He had surpassed his father’s skill in engineering and blacksmithing, putting him in a good place given the circumstances. He trained for years in heavy weapons handling, even getting into a few fights himself, that was until, the fall. Now with a clear path paved, he left home, leaving all his accumulated wealth with his parents, in search for greater purpose.
