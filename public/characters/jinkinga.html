            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>Standing at 5.1 feet tall (About 1'58cm), his body shape is pretty average and alongside his low stature he weights 50kg (110 pounds).
                He almost doesnt walk but instead makes little jumps to move around the place.
                One of the most eye-catching attributes of his body is his face in general, having four eyes and a strange jaw that can split into two parts, poking out through his blue hair, there is a pair of small caprine horns, when he shows he teeth one could see how sharp and dangerous they look, specially the fangs. He has the ability to hiss with a pretty long, slender and nifty snake tongue.
                His legs are raptor-like, having scales instead of fur.</p>
