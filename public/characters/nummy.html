            <p><u>Description</u></p>
            <p>He's a cautious fox that likes to mostly be alone or at the company of one or two very close friends at the same time. His words and tongue are like his weapons: few, quick and extremely sharp. Cunning and fond of double entendre, he can be quite the jokester when warmed up into conversation, but brutally rude with people who speak too much and say too little. His biggest motivations are: protecting his loved ones' interests, being able to sleep confortably and honing his sharpshooting skills. Despite his eloquency, he can get flustered easily and pronounce words too quickly, making others unable to understand what he's saying. This makes him favour other ways of nonverbal communication. He can also be quite insecure about losing his eyesight or his able hands, so he makes a priority to always protect himself with goggles and gloves. By far his biggest fear and most disliked feeling is being powerless to help someone he cares about, so he's insecure in being in any postions which leave him open or vulnerable, even if that means missing opportunities. While waiting for prey, he likes cracking the bones on his hands anxiously, which may have contributed to some of them being unintentionally alerted to his presence.</p>

            <p><u>Backstory</u></p>
            <p>
                Focused like an arrow on his own ambitions of independence, the fox never liked learning from others, so he is moslty self-taught in the arts of the marksman, relying on experience rather than theory. His family pushed him to pursue the arts of magic, where he found his affinity in the water-related magics such as cryomancy, but he does not like relying on them, unless he's pushed to a point where he's forced to.
