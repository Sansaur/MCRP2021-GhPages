    <h1 class="inner-main-title font-fantasie">Faction creation</h1>
    <div class="font-serif bigger-font pl-3">
        <p>Factions need a minimum of 2 members and activity by at least the same amount of people</p>
        <p>If a faction remains fully inactive their territories will be kept as "standby" for up to a month, afterwards everything inside will be deleted and they'll become "ruins"</p>
        <p>Requirements:</p>
        <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>Name of the faction</li>
            <li>Leader's character</li>
            <li>Coordinates of the main base (The whole biome will belong to the faction) + Which biome is it</li>
            <li>Starting members</li>
            <li>Backstory</li>
            <li>Purpose</li>
            <li>Member rules</li>
            <li>Standing with other currently existing factions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's possible to have an "organic" start instead, without as much focus on the faction's backstory and instead build it up as you go, you still have to fill all the fields given beforehand, but at the start of the server you can begin with just these:</p>
        <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>Leader's character</li>
            <li>Which biome do you want (I'll pick the coordinates)</li>
            <li>Starting members</li>
        </ul>
