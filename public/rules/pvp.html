                    You can pick either being fully immune to premeditated aggressions and never being a target of them. 
                    Or you can provide a whitelist of which actions you allow aggressors to perform onto you

                    You accept any consequences if you fall victim to premeditated aggressions and the aggressors may roleplay anything they wish
                    even if later you still keep your rights to make it a canon event onto your character or not
