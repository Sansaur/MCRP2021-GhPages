        <p>
            You are not to harm your own faction members or have clashing contracts that interfere with one another. your contract is law, you must abide by it at any cost. do not accept contracts without prior knowledge of the target. whoever pays more, has higher priority. your only duties at the base is to strengthen yourself.

        <ol>
            Standings are purely based per contract if a faction is listed as a target
