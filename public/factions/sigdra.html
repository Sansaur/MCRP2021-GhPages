        <p><i>Followers of the god Sigdra, a capricious and impious god, emerged from fear and misery after the fall of the dark lord. After the deaths during the war and the abuses of the opposing side, those lucky enough to stay alive were entrusted under the power of this ancient and powerful god, forbidden by some and unnameable by others.
            The shadows, as that is what we who belong to this faction call ourselves, we defend the great and powerful name of our god Sigdra, who has called us to restore the dark power on earth and give us the power to rule over the other peoples, expanding its influence to every corner of the planet
            We are characterized by our great faith above all else, and ambition, we do not allow the name of our god to be used in vain.
            We are not only believers, we are also warriors, fighters, and defenders trained to go to war if necessary for defending Sigdra and under her dark blessing.</i></p>
